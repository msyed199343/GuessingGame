# GuessingGame

#This Guessing Game is a project I created while I did App Academy Open. It's a terminal-based game where you try to guess the secret number. This game helped me understand how to use Readline in Javascript and get user input asynchronously.  

#1. To start the game, load the file in Node. 

#2. The game will ask (in your terminal) how many turns you would like; to guess the secret number. (Enter the number of guesses you would like in the terminal)

#3. The game will ask you a range of numbers (A MIN and a MAX), so it can choose your secret number between the min and max. 

#4 Guess the number before your turns run out; if you don't, it will prompt you that you have lost.  

#GOOD LUCK!
